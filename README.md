## Introduction

The *Heat Smart Orkney* project investigates the issue of wind energy curtailment on Orkney, where the renewable generation capacity often exceeds the local demand and the export limitations of a 40 MW interconnector. To address this, the project aims to utilise residential demand response (DR) technology developed by Kaluza, allowing local residents to consume excess energy, thereby reducing energy curtailment and enhancing renewable energy utilisation.

---

## Project Goals üéØ

1. **Curtailment Reduction**  
   - Quantify and reduce energy curtailment by increasing residential demand during periods of excess wind generation.

2. **Sustainable Demand Response**  
   - Evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of using DR to defer energy curtailment through residential heating systems.

3. **Economic and Environmental Impact**  
   - Analyse the potential savings for households, revenue opportunities for energy providers, and environmental benefits from reduced wastage of renewable energy.

## Technical Overview üîç

The project involves the following:

- **Wind Curtailment Analysis**: Assess the instances and volumes of curtailed energy due to local grid limitations.
- **DR Technology Implementation**: Investigate Kaluza‚Äôs DR solution using Quantum heaters to control residential demand in real-time.
- **Energy Consumption Modelling**: Model household energy consumption patterns and determine the DR penetration required to make the solution viable.

---

## Data and Assumptions üìä

The analysis is based on several key datasets and assumptions:

- **Curtailment Data**: Historical data on wind energy curtailment across Orkney‚Äôs wind farms.
- **Residential Demand**: Data on household energy consumption, with seasonal and daily patterns to model typical demand.
- **Export Capacity**: A 40 MW interconnector that limits energy export from Orkney to the mainland.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Residential demand was estimated for the entire Orkney area by scaling data from a sample set.
  - Typical Quantum heater cost assumed for the DR solution implementation.
  - Estimates for potential DR adoption rates and penetration necessary for economic viability.

## Key Analytical Phases üîß

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
   - Clean and organise data on curtailment, residential demand, and wind generation.
   - Scale residential demand data based on sample sizes to estimate total demand in Orkney.

2. **Curtailment Impact Analysis**
   - Quantify the impact of curtailment on local generators, examining seasonal and daily patterns.

3. **DR Modelling for Demand Shaping**
   - Develop scenarios to model how residential demand could be increased during peak curtailment times, using Kaluza‚Äôs DR technology.
   - Perform sensitivity analysis on DR penetration rates to determine break-even points and cost-benefit metrics.

4. **Financial and Environmental Analysis**
   - Evaluate potential economic benefits for households, revenue gains for local energy producers, and reduced emissions due to curtailment reduction.
   - Consider challenges, such as the sustainability of subsidies and consumer adoption rates.
